A long time ago, there was a monkey who lived in a rose-apple tree by the side of a river.
He lived alone, but was very happy. 

One day, a crocodile came out of the river. He swam up to the tree and told the monkey that he had travelled a 
long distance and was in search of food as he was very hungry.
